# SocWatch-Analyzer
A tool for processing and analyzing SocWatch traces to monitor and optimize power consumption and device states on platforms, with a focus on CPU, PCH sleep states, and system performance

## Overview

The SocWatch Analyzer project is designed to process and analyze system-level traces generated by **SocWatch**. This tool is crucial for analyzing power consumption, performance metrics, and device states for platforms, specifically focusing on CPU states, PCH (Platform Controller Hub) sleep states, and various power management features.

This repository includes several Python scripts and configuration files that assist in loading, processing, and extracting data from `.csv` traces captured by SocWatch. The data is parsed to gather insights on system behavior, such as CPU power states, monitor usage, and device activity, enabling system optimization and power analysis.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Processing**: Scripts that load SocWatch trace files and process various states like C-States, SLP-S0 states, and ACPI states.
- **Power State Analysis**: Analyze residency percentages, blocking reasons, and power state transitions to identify areas for power optimization.
- **Device State Analysis**: Track device states (like D0, D1, D2, D3) to monitor and optimize device power usage.
- **Detailed Data Extraction**: Extract and format system performance data, including CPU cores, monitor states, and more.

## Installation

To run this analysis tool, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/socwatch-analyzer.git
cd socwatch-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Analyzer

To run the SocWatch analyzer, execute the main Python script with the following command:

```bash
python checking_attributes (1).py <path_to_your_socwatch_trace.csv>
```

This will load the SocWatch trace, process the data, and print out relevant power state statistics.

### Example Output

The output will display data such as:

```
C-State Residency Percentages:
{
    'PC0': 0.5,
    'PC1': 15.2,
    ...
}
```
